\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{manuscript_files/figure-latex/fig1_signals-1} \caption{Different types of simulated signals, to which was added 5 types of noise (violet, blue, white, pink, and brown) with different intensities. For each signal type, the first row shows the signal with a minimal amount of noise, and the last with a maximal amount of noise. We can see that adding Brown noise turns the signal into a Random-walk (i.e., a Brownian motion).}(\#fig:fig1_signals)
