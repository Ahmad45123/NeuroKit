We submit an original review article titled: "The Structure of Chaos: An Empirical Comparison of Fractal Physiology Complexity Indices using NeuroKit2" by Dominique Makowski, Anshu Te, Tam Pham, Zen J. Lau and S.H. Annabel Chen for consideration to be published in *journal*. 

The concepts and methods of complexity science have increasingly gained traction and been translated for use in psychophysiology as new measures for its quantification have emerged from compuational and mathematical advances. However, few studies have attempted to objectively compare the relationship and performance of the plethora of metrics available. In this paper, we systematically compared 125 complexity indices by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions and their empirical proximity with other indices. Our analysis and review thereby highlighted a selection of 12 indices that might be complimentary in regards to the quantification of the complexity of a time series.   

We believe this work to be especially well suited for publication in *Journal* and highly relevant to a broader scientific readership because it not only provides novel insight into the methods of the growing field of complexity science, but also serves as a complexity indices selection guide for researchers, hence increasing its empirical application and potentially further advancing the translation of the theories and methods of complexity in other scientific fields.

All data presented in this manuscript is original. As it is our lab's aim to set high standards of reproducibility and transparency, while generating and publishing high quality data, all analysis work-flows, and scripts to generate the data have been made publicly available for other researchers to utilize. A preprint version of this manuscript has also been made available through *somewhere*.
