  Complexity quantification, through entropy, information and fractal dimension indices, is gaining a renewed traction in psychophsyiology, as new measures with promising qualities emerge from the computational and mathematical advances. Unfortunately, few studies compare the relationship and objective performance of the plethora of existing metrics, in turn hindering reproducibility, replicability, consistency, and clarity in the field. In this study, we systematically compared a non-exhaustive list of 125 complexity indices that are predominantly used in research analyses (available via Neurokit2) by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions, and empirical proximity with other indices. Twelve indices which explained 91.01% of the total variance of the entirety of the indices was thus selected and organized in the order that maximized the variance explained. As such, we propose that a selection of these twelve indices, including *ShanEn (D)*, *MSWPEn*, *CWPEn*, *FuzzyMSEn*, *AttEn*, *NLDFD*, *Hjorth*, *MFDFA (Width`)*, *MFDFA (Max)*, *MFDFA (Mean)*, *SVDEn*, *MFDFA (Increment)*, might offer a complimentary choice in regards to the quantification of the complexity of time series.
