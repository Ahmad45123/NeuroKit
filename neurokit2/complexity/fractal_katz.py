def fractal_katz(signal):

    """Computes Katz's Fractal Dimension (KFD), based on euclidean distances between
    successive points in the signal which are summed and averaged,
    and the maximum distance between the starting and any other point in the sample.

    Here, fractal dimensions range from 1.0 for straight lines, through
    approximately 1.15 for random-walk waveforms, to approaching 1.5 for the most
    convoluted waveforms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series, np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values or in
        the form of an n-dimensional array (with a shape of len(channels) x len(samples))
        or dataframe.

    Returns
    -------
    kfd : float
        Katz's fractal dimension of the single time series, or the mean KFD across the
        channels of an n-dimensional time series.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information regarding the parameters used
        to compute Katz's fractal dimension and the individual KFD values of each
        channel if an n-dimensional time series is passed.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=2, frequency=5, noise=10)
    >>>
    >>> kfd, parameters = nk.fractal_katz(signal)
    >>> kfd #doctest: +SKIP
