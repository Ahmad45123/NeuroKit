def complexity_recurrence(signal, delay=1, dimension=10, tolerance="default", show=False):
    """Recurrence matrix (Python implementation)

    Fast pure Python implementation of recurrence matrix (tested against pyrqa).

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.ndarray, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    delay : int
        Time delay (often denoted 'Tau', sometimes referred to as 'lag'). In practice, it is common
        to have a fixed time lag (corresponding for instance to the sampling rate; Gautama, 2003),
        or to find a suitable value using some algorithmic heuristics (see ``delay_optimal()``).
    dimension : int
        Embedding dimension (often denoted 'm' or 'd', sometimes referred to as 'order'). Typically
        2 or 3. It corresponds to the number of compared runs of lagged data. If 2, the embedding
        returns an array with two columns corresponding to the original signal and its delayed (by
        Tau) version.
    tolerance : float
        Tolerance (similarity threshold, often denoted as 'r'). The radius used for detecting
        neighbours (states considered as recurrent). A rule of thumb is to set 'r' so that the
         percentage of points classified as recurrences is about 2-5%.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        The recurrence matrix.
